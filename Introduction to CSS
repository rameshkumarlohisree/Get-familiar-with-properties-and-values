       <h1 style="color: brown;"> The Life Of Sri Krishna</h1>
     </center>
     <p style="color: blue;">In 3228 BCE in Mathura, India, a child was born who was destined to reshape the spiritual and temporal destiny of
    mankind—Sri Krishna. In his 125 years of life, Sri Krishna made an indelible impression upon mankind’s collective
    consciousness—re-educating the world about devotion and dharma as well as the ultimate reality. His life was a model for
    people in days past, the modern world and surely for those in ages to come. Seeing Krishna as a perfect personification
    of divinity, to this day hundreds of millions of people pray to him, chant his names, meditate on his form and try to
    put his teachings into practice. His life has inspired a treasure house of poetry, music, painting, sculpture and other
    fine arts. As Amma says, “His glory is unsurpassable. His story is a source of joy and inspiration for people from all
    walks of life.” </p>
    <p style="color:blue" id="i2">A child, a brother, a charioteer, a warrior, a disciple, a guru, a cowherd, a messenger, the beloved of the gopis…
    Throughout his life, Krishna enacted so many roles—the whole time never forgetting that they were just that, roles and
    that his true nature was eternal, ever blissful consciousness. In this way, he was able to remain detached and thus
    perform flawlessly, never allowing the smile to fall from his face. This, Amma says, is perhaps his greatest teaching. </p>
    <p style="color: blue;">“There have been very few who have been able to rejoice both in victory and in defeat,” Amma says. “Sri Krishna is one
    who celebrated both life and death. That is why he was always able to give a big smile. He took birth with a smile on
    his face, lived with a smile, and left his body with a smile. The message that he conveyed through his life is that we
    should make life full of laughter.”</p>
    <p style="color: blue;" class="c1">Krishna’s life was so full, it would be impossible to recount it all here. It is told primarily through Srimad
    Bhagavatam, Garga Samhita, Visnu Purana, Brahmavaivarta Purana, Mahabharata, Harivamsa and several other puranas.
    However, here are some of the broad strokes.</p>
    <p style="color: blue;">Krishna, in fact, took birth in a prison cell. A sage had told his egoistic uncle, King Kamsa, that he would be killed
    by his sister Devaki’s child. So Kamsa imprisoned Devaki and had each child she bore murdered. However, Devaki, and her
    husband, Vasudeva, finally were able to sneak one child off to safety. This was Sri Krishna. They sent Krishna off to
    Vraja, where he was raised by a foster mother, Yasoda. It was in Vrindavan, one of the villages of Vraja, that Krishna
    won the hearts of the gopis, the cowherds of the village. “By spending all his time with the gopis of Vrindavan—playing
    with them, joking with them, stealing their butter and milk, etc—what he actually was doing was stealing their hearts,”
    Amma says. It is from this that Krishna was given the name “Chitta Chora” [one who steals the mind].</p>
